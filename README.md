## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/ovrj4qI.png)

This is a open source Java discord bot making use of the JDA library API. I built this project for fun and to develop my knowledge with programming and Java, this project can be used as a code base for your Java discord bot!

What I learned from this project:

* Developing my skills with Java
* Design elements, implementing visual ideas
* Working with full stack, from design and front end to back end
* Using API's (JDA)
* Learning Object Oriented programming techniques
* Learning optimization techniques for performance
* Running a always-on server

## Commands

Here is a full list of commands this bot currently supports

* info Displays information about the bot.
* anime Posts a random anime image from a database.
* cat Posts a random cat image from a database (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
* meme Posts a random meme image from a database (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
* play plays a song from a provided youtube url
* clear (value) deletes a user defined amount of previous messages
* commands displays this information screen
* Overwatch predicts the outcome of your next Overwatch game
* updateinfo displays the latest changes and new commands added to the bot

More commands are on the way as this project is still a work in progress.
